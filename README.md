### andrewjamesmoore.com (personal portfolio)

For this version of my portfolio, I shifted the focus from fancy animations and fads to creating a stripped-down experience. By moving away from flashy visuals and complex frontend frameworks, I was able to get back to the basicsâ€”prioritizing speed, accessibility, and simplicity. This approach not only helped streamline the development but also allowed me to create a fast, lightweight portfolio that emphasizes performance without sacrificing modern features like dark mode and responsive design. Not finished by any means but something to get up and build upon.
