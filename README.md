In past versions, I've spent a lot of time focusing on the visuals of my own portfolio. Often experimenting with libraries, animations, and the latest styling trends. For this project, I shifted the focus to creating a more stripped-down, barebones experience. By moving away from flashy visuals and complex frontend frameworks, I was able to get back to the basicsâ€”prioritizing speed, accessibility, and simplicity. This approach not only helped streamline development but also allowed me to create a fast, lightweight portfolio that emphasizes performance without sacrificing modern features like dark mode and responsive design.
